# Rollup Loader Notes

I attempted to intercept the result of the Rollup loader before the code hit the Babel loader and found that the Babel loader seems to affect the Rollup output, no matter what order I place the Babel and Rollup loaders. I ideally want the Babel loader to take the tree-shaken Rollup output and transpile it to ES5. This would mean that the code generated by the Rollup loader when the Babel loader is enabled after it to be the same as the code when the Babel loader is off.

To try and put the Babel loader after the Rollup loader, I put the Babel loader above the Rollup loader in the `plugins` array of the Webpack config since loaders are applied from bottom-to-top ([Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32234329/what-is-the-loader-order-for-webpack)). However, no matter what order I place Babel and Rollup, the Rollup result is being transpiled and unused code gets excluded.

Btw, I'm intercepting the result by taking what I assume is the Rollup-generated code at this point in the Webpack compilation pipeline by writing to a file through a Node Writable Stream.
